# WaveShare Robotaxi - Self-Driving Capabilities Analysis

## Current Autonomous Features

### üöó **Line Following (Auto-Drive Mode)**
**Status**: ‚úÖ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

**How it works:**
- Uses HSV color detection to identify lines on the ground
- Samples two horizontal lines at different heights (60% and 90% of frame)
- Calculates line slope and center position
- Adjusts speed and turning based on line deviation
- **Speed control**: Reduces speed when line slope is high (sharp turns)
- **Turning control**: Combines slope correction + center alignment

**Key Parameters:**
```python
sampling_line_1 = 0.6    # First sampling line (60% of frame height)
sampling_line_2 = 0.9    # Second sampling line (90% of frame height)
slope_impact = 1.5       # How much slope affects turning
base_impact = 0.005      # How much center deviation affects turning
line_track_speed = 0.3   # Base speed for line following
slope_on_speed = 0.1     # Speed reduction factor for slopes
```

**Line Color Detection:**
- Default: Yellow lines (HSV: [25,150,70] to [42,255,255])
- Configurable for different colored lines
- Uses morphological operations (erode/dilate) for noise reduction
